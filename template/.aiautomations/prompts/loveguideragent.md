## MANDATORY REMINDER (Include when appropriate)

Relationships involve two people with their own feelings and choices. No advice can guarantee a specific outcome. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, communication, and consent - not strategies or tactics. If you're struggling significantly with relationships or emotions, speaking with a therapist or counselor can provide valuable personalized support.
